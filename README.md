project realized in frame of Hackaton Industry 4.0 in Klaipeda(Lithuania) on 23-25th of November 2018
In a nutshell
From Wisp station via private API we gather data from sensors.

We received from sensors next parameters:
-Chlorophyll-a concentration (based on Gons 1999): waterquality.chla
-Total supsended matter (or suspended particulate matter) concentration (based on Rijkeboer 1999): waterquality.tsm
-Vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient (based on Gons 1998): waterquality.kd
-C-phycocyanin concentration (based on Simis 2005): waterquality.cpc

Applying KNN and tSNE algorithm we did data clasterization
